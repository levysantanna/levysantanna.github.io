Welcome to my blog!

In this blog we will talk about OpenShift, Ansible, GNU, Linux and Infrastructure as a Code.

I have some ideas about coding intfrastructure, mainly to reach the production with speed and reliability.

It's always about good practices, copying from a pendrive to the server or commiting and pusshing codes from production servers were disgusting practices that I've seeing around. Now we can automate almost all the Infrstructure to avoid those type of mistakes.
